# Fog

Tools to see through the data fog. Based on probabilistic programming and
monte carlo simulations.

## How To
When analyzing data a deliverable has 4 steps:

1. Data reader: Fetches data from the internet or reads from local files.
2. Programs / Distributions: Models that are lifted into probability
   distributions. We think about this as normal programs.
3. Testing: Code that does sanity checks and (shallow) verification that the
   distributions indeed describe the data.
4. Reporting.
